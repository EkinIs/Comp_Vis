## This repository contains experiments on two topics:

_Image Stitching:_ Combining photos, extracting simple parameters from the results, saving them in pandas DataFrames, and visualizing the data.

_Stereo Distance:_ Generating disparity and depth maps from stereo images, and estimating the distance to several automatically selected points.

All experiments are implemented with Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

## In short:
These are not full applications, but small experiments on stitching and stereo distance estimation.
